Here are some of my projects I had done.

# My Cryptography Project

This project was my second year university project for datastructures and algorithms. The project is about converting sentences into SHA 256 hash code, and trying
to get the highest similarity between them. I had done this by having one class and three methods, main class was to store the data. first method called sha256, this method was 
transforming english sentences into sha256 hash code. Second method called CheckForSimilaritiesBetweenHashes, this method would take in two strings and check for similarities. This class
would return the number of similarities. Third method is called TheLargestSimilarity, this method takes in an array and returns maximum value from that array. Essentially giving me the 
highest similarity from my sentences, in which I used from Crime and Punishment by Fyodor Dostoevsky.
